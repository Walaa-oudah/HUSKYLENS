# HUSKYLENS

This repository contains a guide and Arduino code that is about using Huskylens Ai features to process adding vision capabilities to any project. In this task specifically we are going to use other feature which is the capability of learning for huskylens.


# Note:  This task shows the basic function of a library for HUSKYLENS.


# About HUSKYLENS

HuskyLens is an easy-to-use AI machine vision sensor with 7 built-in functions: face recognition, object tracking, object recognition, line tracking, color recognition, tag recognition and object classification. HuskyLens can connect to Arduino and micro:bit to help you make very creative projects without playing with complex algorithms.
